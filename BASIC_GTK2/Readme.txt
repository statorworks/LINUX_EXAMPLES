This is a simple windowed demo with GTK2 widgets framework, instead of low level libX control.
Using this template you can quickly implement a fixed size window application for a robot console or a machine HMI.

Please see Screenshot.png to see how the test window looks.

System preparation:
apt-get install gtk2.0
apt-get install gtk2.0-dev



Enjoy!
