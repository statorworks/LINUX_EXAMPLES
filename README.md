#LINUX_EXAMPLES
I've been learning some Linux over the past couple of years, being more interested in the aplication development part as opposed to system administration.
Here are some some example C++ projects I've been creating to test different application capabilities. 

One can use an example as a starting point and then grab features from the others, this hould help newbies so as to minimizae forum souring.
More examples are on the way as I get more time available.

-Created on Debian Jessie / Raspbian
-Some examples are meant for the RasPi as opposed to a desktop, this is the case of the I2C and SPI.

Enjoy!
